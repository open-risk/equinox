**Equinox** is an open source platform for sustainable portfolio management. Equinox implements and integrates a number of regulatory and industry standards that address GHG emissions attribution and reporting and enables the associated ESG risk analysis.

These pages serve as online **technical documentation** of the equinox platform explaining its code structure and administration. For **user oriented documentation** and supported portfolio management workflows please consult the `Equinox User Manuals <https://www.openriskmanagement.com/equinox/>`_

.. note:: The equinox project and its documentation is still in the development phase and is not yet suitable for production deployments. Feel free to contact us for the development roadmap and any other requests / feedback.
